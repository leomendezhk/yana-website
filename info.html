    <div class="container grid grid--3-cols">
      <div class="question">
        <h3 class="question-title">Do you shoot film or digital?</h3>
        <p class="question-answer">While  digital cameras play a crucial and integral part of how I capture stories, film will always be at the heart of how we see and document the world. On wedding days and portrait sessions, I shoot a mixture of both digital and film images!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="question">
        <h3 class="question-title">What is your booking process like?</h3>
        <p class="question-answer">It's super simple! Just fill out the <a href="" class="link"><span class="strong">Contact Form</span></a> on my site or email me at <a href="mailto:yanaoiconomou@gamil.com" class="link">yanaoiconomou@gamil.com</a>  with your details.

      <div class="question">
        <h3 class="question-title">My partner doesn't like being in front of the camera. Is that okay?</h3>
        <p class="question-answer">That is totally fine! My couples tell me this all the time, and we always end up having so much fun. It's my job to make you both feel as comfortable as possible & I have some tricks up my sleeve to do that. I am big on giving guidance throughout the shoot and will never just leave you guys standing there not knowing what to do.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="question">
        <h3 class="question-title">Do you take "traditional photos as well?</h3>
        <p class="question-answer">I'm all about documenting authentic moments for exactly the way they looked. However, I think it's so important to have photos smiling directly at the camera, family photos, group photos, etc. So, don't worry, i'll totally be capturing those too! It just won't feel stiff and posed. I'll give you direction, so we have fun taking these types of photos as well.</p>

All travel arrangements are taken care of on my end, so you won't have to worry about booking anything for me.</p>
