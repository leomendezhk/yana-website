        <p class="about-text">
          Yana is a Cyprus based photographer, but grew up in a small remote town in Russia . Combining her fine art photography & modelling studies, along with a skilled and sensitive eye for portraiture, her images garnered acclaim for their honesty, vulnerability, and unfeigned connection to its subjects. Well traveled and always up for an adventure, she has photographed celebrations across the world, from Europe to Asia, from Frace to Hong kong and beyond, always bringing a unique editorial and artistic sensibility to the photography world.
          With over 10 years of professional experience, Yana's photographic journey has assumed a rich and varied path. Her work has been featured in Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Brides, C Magazine and more.
          <br><br>
          Yana: <span>“I photograph many stunning projects every year, however, I approach every session in the same way, with the belief that I am there to tell each person unique, beautiful story. For me, capturing once in a lifetime emotions drives me forward as a photographer.”</span>

      <div class="question">
        <h3 class="question-title">Do you shoot film or digital?</h3>
        <p class="question-answer">While  digital cameras play a crucial and integral part of how I capture stories, film will always be at the heart of how we see and document the world. On wedding days and portrait sessions, I shoot a mixture of both digital and film images!</p>
      </div>
    
      <div class="question">
        <h3 class="question-title">What is your booking process like?</h3>
        <p class="question-answer">It's super simple! Just fill out the <a href="" class="link"><span class="strong">Contact Form</span></a> on my site or email me at <a href="mailto:yanaoiconomou@gamil.com" class="link">yanaoiconomou@gamil.com</a>  with your details. I'll send you an email back within 48 hrs to get to know each other! To book, I require a signed contract. After that, i'll send you a questionnaire & invoice. I require full payment  prior to your date.</p>
      </div>
   
      <div class="question">
        <h3 class="question-title">My partner doesn't like being in front of the camera. Is that okay?</h3>
        <p class="question-answer">That is totally fine! My couples tell me this all the time, and we always end up having so much fun. It's my job to make you both feel as comfortable as possible & I have some tricks up my sleeve to do that. I am big on giving guidance throughout the shoot and will never just leave you guys standing there not knowing what to do.</p>
      </div>
    
      <div class="question">
        <h3 class="question-title">Do you take "traditional photos as well?</h3>
        <p class="question-answer">I'm all about documenting authentic moments for exactly the way they looked. However, I think it's so important to have photos smiling directly at the camera, family photos, group photos, etc. So, don't worry, i'll totally be capturing those too! It just won't feel stiff and posed. I'll give you direction, so we have fun taking these types of photos as well.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="question">
        <h3 class="question-title">Do you travel outside of Cyprus for work?</h3>
        <p class="question-answer">Yes! I absolutely love to travel and have photographed couples & weddings all over the world! I take on a limited number of destination shoots/ weddings each year, so please reach out in advanced to plan your date. All travel arrangements are taken care of on my end, so you won't have to worry about booking anything for me.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="question">
        <h3 class="question-title">When do we get to see our photos?</h3>
        <p class="question-answer">I will have the final collection of photographs ready for you to view 3 weeks after your booked date. Each image is individually edited with great care not something to be rushed.</p>
