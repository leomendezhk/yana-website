### Section Intro

Hi! I'm Yana. For the last 4 years I have been doing photography. I moved to Cyprus 1.5 year ago and gave a birth to my beautiful daughter Athena. My job is to capture every special memory so you and your loved ones can just let go and live in the moment, and that your photos leave you with effortless memories and all the feels to help you relive your day.
